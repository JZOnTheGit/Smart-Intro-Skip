# Smart Intro Skip (Kodi)

Skips TV intros using timestamps from **[TheIntroDB](https://theintrodb.org)**. Shows a skip button until the intro ends or you press it.

## Credits

Database and API: **[TheIntroDB](https://theintrodb.org)** — community-submitted timings.

This addon is just a Kodi client; it’s not run by them.

## Compatibility (Seren, Umbrella, etc.)

Nothing here is tied to one streaming addon. The service reads **whatever Kodi’s player has for the current file** — usually via `VideoInfoTag` and JSON-RPC (`uniqueid`, season, episode).

So it works with **Seren, Fen, Umbrella, or your local library** as long as the playing item actually has a **TMDB id** (and season + episode for TV). Some addons only set IMDB or leave IDs empty; then TheIntroDB can’t match. That’s a metadata problem.

## Features

- Pulls intro in/out from TheIntroDB
- Skip button stays up for the whole intro (or auto-skip if you turn that on)
- One HTTP request per episode when you have IDs
